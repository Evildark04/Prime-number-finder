# Prime-number-finder
-> This finds the prime numbers whose product you have given as the input 

Use Case :
        Not too long ago , people where using this technology to encrypt and decrypt messgaes sent to anonymous people .
Only people with atleast one prime number from the product can access the data.

Limitation :
        1) Since its a c program it can't work with larger number
        2) It uses lot of resources for larger number
        
Feel free to suggest tips to make it efficient
